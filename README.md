##Deitel and Deitel - Java How to Program 9th Edition

####My solutions to most, eventually all, of the books problems.
> - Also contains the example programs used to introduce topics.

This is a wip and is being used as a tool for learning Java so don't expect
perfection right off of the bat.

I am also not mathematically proficient in the slightest so some of the
solutions may not be done in the most efficient, or even correct, way.
