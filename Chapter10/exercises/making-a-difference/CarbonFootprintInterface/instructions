Create three small classes unrelated by inheritance:
Building, Car, Bicycle.

Give each class some unique appropriate attributes and behaviours that it
does not have in common with other classes.

Write an interface CarbonFootprint with a getCarbonFootprint method.

Have each class implement that interface, so that its getCarbonFootprint
method calculates an appropriate carbon footprint for that class.

Write an application that creates objects of each of the three classes,
places references to those objects in ArrayList<CarbonFootprint>, then
iterates through the ArrayList, polymorphically invoking each object's
getCarbonFootprint method.

For each object, print some identifying information and the object's
carbon footprint.
